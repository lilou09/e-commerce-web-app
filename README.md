# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

it was hard project for me i learned a new complex stuff like React context api  and firebase 
i coded it along with an instructor, the problem was the video was a bit outdated so i used a lot of googling to learn the new concepts e.g: firebase and importing it.

next time i will learn redux and redone the project with it.

Thanks if you are reading this and hopefully i am getting better at programming
